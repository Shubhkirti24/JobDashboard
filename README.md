# AGC2 : Creating a Job and skill mapping dashboard using Tableau and the ONET database (2022)

The main aim of this project was to create an interactive Tableau dashboard using the ONET data to visualise the current employment characterics in the USA, based on parameters such as Age, Location, Skills, Knowledge, Education, Experience, etc.

The interactive dashboard can be seen in the video. The photos folder contains all the relevant data visualization techniques used. The SQL folder contains the Normal and the Advanced SQL queries (optimsed using Relational Algebra.)

The O*NET Database is a collection of occupational information that is designed to support job seekers, employers, and workforce development professionals. The database contains a variety of individual files, each of which provides different types of information about different aspects of the labor market.

The Occupation Data file contains detailed information on over 1,000 occupations, including job requirements, work activities, and skills. The Abilities Data file provides information on the abilities that are required for different occupations, while the Interests Data file provides information on the interests that are commonly associated with different careers.


In addition to these files, the O*NET Database also includes several other files that provide information on job titles, task statements, and occupational classifications. Together, these files provide a comprehensive view of the labor market and can be used to support a wide range of workforce development activities.

The dataset that will be used for this project includes federal occupation data sets and a set of job descriptions. These data sets will be used to develop occupation maps that reveal underlying relationships between occupations based on various factors such as skills, abilities, and knowledge. The data will be filtered to provide different views of employment projections, strategic needs, and risk for automation in the AI/ML and robotics fields. Additionally, the dataset will include information on average wages across multiple views such as state and metropolitan areas and industry groups.
